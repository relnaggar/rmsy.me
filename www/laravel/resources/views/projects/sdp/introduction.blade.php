<p>
  Welcome to the mayhem and madness of the System Design Project (SDP), the
  educational equivalent of doing a handstand on a tightrope whilst juggling
  chainsaws.
  This rite of passage for third-year Informatics students at the University of
  Edinburgh was a four-month roller coaster ride of pain and perspiration,
  confusion and chaos, ultimately (for us) resulting in a triumphant team of two
  football-playing LEGO robots that competed together to win second place in the
  annual competition-to-end-all-competitions.
</p>

<p>
  Each group of six students was responsible for constructing a separate robot,
  but in our case, due to unforeseen circumstances (shit happens), our group
  comprised just four committed individuals.
  But we soldiered on, banding together to beat the odds and build what would
  become known in hushed and awed voices as Robo-Messi: the robot that
  single-handedly scored the most goals in the competition.
</p>

<p>
  In the warzone that was our robo-football endeavor, each LEGO soldier was
  connected by an unseen thread of radio waves to a commander-in-chief computer.
  To crank up the drama, there was even an eye in the sky -- an all-seeing
  camera, bestowing our earthbound warriors with an eagle's perspective of the
  battlefield.
</p>

<p>
  Overall, the SDP wasn't just a challenge; it was our personal Mount Everest,
  complete with not just learning curves but sheer learning cliff faces.
  It was our initiation rite into the world of software engineering, where we
  learned to juggle error messages with existential crises and malfunctioning
  motors with tireless teamwork.
  There's no going back now!
