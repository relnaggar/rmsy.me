  Welcome to my slice of the internet pie!
</p>

<p>
  Hi, I'm Ramsey ðŸ‘‹ I'm a software engineer, and without exaggerating
  in the slightest, this website is
  <a href="/projects/rmsy-me/">my Mona Lisa</a>.
  My digital masterpiece, constructed brick by binary brick with the sweat from
  my brow as its everlasting mortar.
  I carved this space with my raw and bleeding fingers to serve as a testament
  to the proficiencies I've honed throughout my professional odyssey.
<p>
  
<p>
  Pull up a chair and dive into my digital saga, featuring:
  <ul>
    <li>
      Five transformative years at the University of Edinburgh, resulting in a
      Master of Informatics with First Class Honours and a newfound appreciation
      for the sanctity of sleep.
    </li>
    <li>
      A thrilling experience as a full stack developer interning at a leading IT
      service management provider: I laughed, I cried, I debugged.
      It was there that I sharpened my skills and grew a thick skin for
      real-world coding dramas.
    </li>
    <li>
      <?= $numberOfYearsTutoringAsWord ?> enlightening years educating the world
      in computer science and software engineering, during which I earned the
      title of the UK's top 'Computing University' tutor on the
      esteemed platform,
      <?=
        (new ExternalLink(
          "https://www.mytutor.co.uk/tutors/24851/",
          "MyTutor",
        ))->render()
      ?>.
      No undergrads were harmed in the making of this story.
