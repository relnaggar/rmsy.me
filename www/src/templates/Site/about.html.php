  I'm a software engineer.
</p>

<p>
  My specialty? Well, I dive into the depths of full-stack web application
  development.
  My journey has taken me from sprucing up hefty existing codebases, to crafting
  a reusable <a href="/projects/website/back">back-end framework</a> from
  scratch -- and all the nitty-gritty coding challenges in between.

  Not too long ago, my curiosity and drive for innovation led me to build a
  <a href="/projects/beetle">dung beetle biorobot</a> -- yes, you read that
  right!
  It was a fascinating adventure that took me from plumbing the profound depths
  of the insect neuroscience literature to stretching the concept of "playing
  with LEGO" to new and extreme heights.
  Believe it or not, I even received a grant to fly out to South Africa and test
  the robot against real dung beetles (spoiler alert: the robot won).

  But wait, there's more to my story.
  You see, I believe that knowledge shared is knowledge multiplied, and I
  absolutely love sharing my knowledge and passion for programming.
  As an

  I've had the joy of introducing undergraduate students to the vast world of
  computer science.
  From the magic of web development, to the elegance of OOP, to the intellectual
  puzzles in algorithms and data structures: we've journeyed through it all,
  there and back again.

  Don't worry though, it's not all work and no play.
  I've also embraced the thrill of the unknown by hitchhiking from London to
  Vienna in 4 days, and honed my warrior spirit through 3 months of intense Muay
   Thai training in Thailand.
  Plus, my university a capella group reached the semi-final of national
  competition Voice Festival UK -- it was Pitch Perfect!
  Currently, I'm mixing syntax with salsa, living a spicy adventure in Valencia
  where my Spanish is improving one bachata beat at a time.
