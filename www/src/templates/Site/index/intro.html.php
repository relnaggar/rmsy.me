  Pull up a chair and dive into my digital saga, featuring:
  <ul>
    <li>
      Five transformative years at the <strong>University of Edinburgh</strong>,
      resulting in a Master of Informatics
      (Computer Science & Intelligent Robotics) with First Class Honours
      and a newfound appreciation for the sanctity of sleep.
    </li>
    <li>
      A thrilling experience as a
      <strong>full stack developer</strong> interning at a leading IT
      service management provider: I laughed, I cried, I debugged.
      It was there that I sharpened my skills and grew a thick skin for
      real-world coding dramas.
    </li>
    <li>
      <?= $numberOfYearsTutoringAsWord ?> years educating the world
      in computer science and software engineering, during which I earned the
      title of the UK's <strong>top 'Computing University' tutor</strong> on a
      leading platform.
      (No undergrads were harmed in the making of this story.)
