  I know what you're thinking: "Finally, a page filled with adorable pictures of
  dung beetles!"
  Alas, I am but a humble software engineer, not exactly the next David
  Attenborough.
  But worry not, this page has something equally captivating â€“- the world's
  first dung beetle biorobot!
  Now that I have your undivided attention, let me take you on the adventure you
  came here for -- follow me into the dangerously glamorous world of dung beetle
  feeding behaviour.
</p>

<p>
  First, a thought experiment.
  Close your eyes, take a deep breath, and imagine you're a dung beetle.
  (This may be an easier leap for some of you than for others.)
  Now, dung-beetle-you is a simple creature, with simple needs.
  Cruising the rolling South African grasslands, hitching a ride on the summer
  breeze, you catch the wafting scent of a fresh juicy dung pile.
  Tasty stuff!
  Descending quickly, you follow your well-honed instincts and quickly get to
  work crafting the perfect dung ball.
  Fast forward to putting the finishing touches on your magnum opus, and with a
  final pat, you step back to bask in the glory of your creation.
  This is the Sistine Chapel of dung balls.
</p>

<p>
  But, uh oh, what's this?  
  You're not the only one who's noticed your fine craftsmanship.
  A nefarious rival has been lurking from the shadows, eyeing up your spherical
  masterpiece with envy.
  He's hungry, he's lazy, and he's clearly got no intention of making his own
  dinner.
  If you want to save your food baby, you've gotta act fast.
  Decision time!
  What do you do?

  If you answered "get the hell out of there", you're thinking like a dung
  beetle.
  In fact, you might have been one in a past life.
  So you probably already know that the quickest way to get out of there is to
  roll your ball in a <strong>straight line</strong> away from the dung heap.
  But have you ever tried walking in a straight line with your eyes closed?
  Not as simple as it seems, right?
  You'll likely end up veering off to the side, or even walking in circles.
  So how do dung beetles do it?
  Well, the secret is... they don't close their eyes!
  Don't tell me you didn't <u>see</u> that coming.
  And some very clever scientists (whom I had the privilege of learning from
  in South Africa) have shown pretty conclusively that dung beetles use what
  they see in the sky to keep their fabulous fecal formations rolling straight
  into the sunset.
  The two most important visual cues are:
  <dl>
    <dt>The intensity-gradient cue.</dt>
    <dd>
      This comes from the position of celestial objects such as the sun, moon,
      and even the stars!
    </dd>
    <dt>The polarisation cue.</dt>
    <dd>
      This comes from the polarisation pattern of the sky (explained more
      below).
