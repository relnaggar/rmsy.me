  So why build a dung beetle robot?
  Well, let me tell you.
  Young Pooptimus Prime isn't just any old robot, he's a
  <strong>biorobot</strong>, meaning he's a model of the real-deal biological
  system, and is used to test hypotheses about how dung beetles think and
  behave, all the way down to their neural circuitry!
  Sporting two independently controlled wheels and a ball-bearing for balance,
  Pooptimus is a lean, mean, dung-ball-rolling machine, and can go straight,
  turn on the spot, or make a forward curve -- all basic dung beetle moves.
  But if you're picturing some sophisticated, state-of-the-art equipment, think
  again.
  Pooptimus is a simple creature, built robustly to withstand the harsh and
  accident-prone life of an experimental biorobot, but cheaply, from nothing but
   LEGO, some electronics, and the special ingredient that brought him to
   life... ❤️ ...that's right, programming!

  But Pooptimus needs more than just movement to be a true dung beetle.
  He has to see like one, too.
  That's why he has a built-in digital camera set to gaze up into the heavens,
  with a fish-eye lens allowing him to perceive light from across a large chunk
  of the sky simultaneously.
  He's also equipped with a custom-built array of four light sensors, each
  filtered at a different angle of polarisation.
  Together, these enable him to calculate the angle of polarisation of the light
  coming from the sky, just like his dung beetle brethren.

<p>
  By the way, if all this polarisation nonesense has you scratching your head,
  here's the 101.
  Polarised light is light that oscillates in a specific direction.
  This direction is different depending on where you look in the sky, and the
  pattern across the sky changes based on the sun's position.
  Nevertheless, if you're looking straight up from a fixed ground position, the
  angle of polarisation remains stable enough for navigation.
  Like the North Star for humans, polarisation helps lost dung beetle souls find
  their path through the wilderness.
  But wait!
  Before you run outside and peer at the sky in vain, you should know that
  humans can't tell the difference between polarised and unpolarised light.
  But guess who can?
  Who's a good robot, who's a good robot?
  That's right, Pooptimus can!
</p>

<p>
  Check out the light sensors in the figure.
  A polarising filter covers the entire setup, permitting only the light
  polarised in a specific direction to pass through.
  As each sensor has its own mini-filter set at a different angle, varying
  light quantities reach each one.
  These four data points together empower Pooptimus to calculate the sky's
  polarisation angle at any moment.
  And with that, he's ready to roll!
