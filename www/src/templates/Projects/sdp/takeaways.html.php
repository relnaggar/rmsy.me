  As I stood amongst a sea of cogs and code, sleep-deprived and buried under a
  mountain of software bugs, I found myself surprisingly infatuated with the
  chaos that was the System Design Project.
  Here's the lowdown on what I gleaned from this tango with technology.

    Teamwork makes the dream work... but only if you communicate!

    Collaborating within our small group was just like a real football team --
    everyone with a distinct role and responsibility, yet all working
    harmoniously towards the same winning vision.
    I learned that patience and trust in others is required to avoid
    micromanaging, and communicating clearly is cruical so that everyone is on
    the same page.
    I also learned that the reality of working in a group is that even with the
    most talented and hardworking group members, busy people with 100 other
    deadlines that week don't always have the time to go the extra mile.
    Nevertheless, to borrow a phrase from Jocko Willink, leadership is taking
    extreme ownership, and in the end I happily took on additional
    responsibilities to ensure the success of the entire team.

  <dt>In the real world, no one tells you how to win.</dt>
  <dd>Academia is well-structured and predictable -- your task is clear, and
    the path to solution is illuminated by textbooks and expert advice.
    However, real-world problems are less like a structured piano concierto and
    more like a jazz improvisation session.
    Throughout the project, we were tossed into the ocean of uncertainty,
    without an instruction manual or a step-by-step guide.
    Whether it was rebuilding the robot for the fourth time, decoding a
    nonsensical sensor reading, or crafting a winning strategy, real-world
    solutions aren't found, they're invented.
